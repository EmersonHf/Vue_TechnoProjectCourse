# Vue_TechnoProjectCourse

this is a vue project course where i've learned from the scratch the sintax code and about ways to handle an API. 
using directives and lifecycle hooks (wich is methods that are activated during a lifecycle of a vue.js component. ex: beforeCreate, created, mount/beforemounted).
